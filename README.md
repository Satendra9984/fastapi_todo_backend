# Todo App Backend with FastAPI

Welcome to the README file for the Todo App Backend developed using FastAPI. This project provides a robust backend solution for managing todo tasks with CRUD operations and integrates JWT authentication for secure user access. PostgreSQL is utilized as the primary database, while SQLite3 is used for local database storage. SQLAlchemy is employed for efficient model mappings and ORM functionalities.

## Features

🚀 **FastAPI**: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

🔒 **JWT Authentication**: Implements JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for secure user authentication and authorization.

🗃️ **PostgreSQL Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database to store todo tasks and user information.

📁 **SQLite3 Local Database**: Uses SQLite3 for local database storage, ensuring seamless development and testing.

🔄 **CRUD Operations**: Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for managing todo tasks.

🔍 **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM for efficient and intuitive database interactions, including model mappings and database queries.
